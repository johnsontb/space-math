Drop optional background images here to enhance the starfield.

Suggested filenames (the app tries these automatically):
- nebula-1.jpg
- nebula-2.jpg
- nebula-3.jpg
- galaxy-1.jpg
- galaxy-2.jpg
- flare.png (lens flare used during warp)

You can use images from the Across The Universe repo:
https://github.com/jesuisundev/acrosstheuniverse/tree/main/public/images

Place any subset of those files in this folder. The app will detect and blend
what it finds. If no images are present, a procedural nebula is used instead.
